Assalaam - o - Alaikum,

This project was made as a semester project for the course, Object Oriented Programming. This project provides user with a command line menu
and provides basic arthmetic and calculus operations on polynomials.

### Commands List :

**new** `[polynomial_name]`	           *-- prompt user to add a new polynomial*\
**integrate** `[polynomial_name]`		    *-- calculates anti-derivative of polynomial*\
**integrate** `[polynomial_name]` from [a] to [b]   -- calculates area from a to b\ 
**diff** `[polynomial_name]`		  *-- calculates derivate* \
**diff** `[polynomial_name]` at [x0]	*-- calculates the value of derivative at x* \
**roots of** `[polynomial_name]`	-- *calculate roots of polynomial (cubic and lower only)*\
**evaluate** `[polynomial_name]` at [x0]  *-- evaluate polynomial at x0*\
`[polynomial1_name]` **+** `[polynomial2_name]`	*-- adds two polynomials*\
`[polynomial1_name]` **-** `[polynomial2_name]`	*-- subtracts two polynomials*\
`[polynomial1_name]` __*__ `[polynomial2_name]` *-- multiplies two polynomials*\
**print**	*-- prints all polynomials saved by the user*\
**exit**    *-- exits out the program*
